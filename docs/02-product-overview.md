- Groups similar spaces (bedrooms, bathrooms)
- Places navigation hotspots at logical transition points
- Creates a logical tour flow (entrance → living areas → bedrooms → backyard)

**Workflow**:
1. Shoot property with 360 camera
2. Upload all images to platform
3. Click "Auto-Generate Tour"
4. Review and fine-tune AI suggestions
5. Add property information and branding
6. Share via Zillow, 360Ghar, or direct link
