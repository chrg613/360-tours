- Show recent tours with quick actions.
- Activity feed (scaffolded, not fully implemented).

## Dashboard stats

`GET /api/v1/dashboard/stats`

### Stat cards

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Total Tours | Count of all non-deleted tours |
| Published Tours | Count of tours with `status=published` |
| Total Views | Sum of `view_count` across all tours |
| Storage Used | Total bytes used / storage limit |

## Recent tours

The dashboard shows a vertical list of recent tours with:

- Tour thumbnail
- Title and status badge
- View count
- Each tour links to its detail page (`/tours/:id`)

## Activity feed

An activity feed component is scaffolded (via `collaborationStore`) but not fully connected. Future implementation will show:

- Tour creation/publication events
- AI job completions
- Collaboration activity (when multi-user editing is added)
